  The main goal of DevCALT is to connect developers with each other who are looking for a partner to collaborate with so they can create things that they imagined without having knowledge barrier. <br /><br />

I myself as a frontend developer, I had a project idea but need a backend developer who can handle the backend part for the project as I work on the frontend so that I can create project without any barrier and I can learn to work with a partner on a same project but it is hard to find a partner.
<br /><br />
DevCALT is here to solve that problem, you just have to post about what kind of developer partner youâ€™re looking for and then they will find you and can reach out to you through social media.
